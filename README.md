## Tools

### IP Lookup

The **IP Lookup** function allows you to retrieve location and network data for a specific IP address by querying `ip-api.com/json/{ip}`.

### Port Scanner

The **Port Scanner** function identifies open ports on a target IP by creating a socket and attempting to connect across a specified port range.

> **Note:** Please use a VPN if you wish to remain anonymous; otherwise, your IP address will be visible to the target.

### Discord Message Spammer

The **Discord Message Spammer** allows you to input one or more account tokens, which are saved to a `token.txt` file for repeated use. You can customize the message and set a repetition count (e.g., if set to 5, every token will send the message 5 times).

To use this, you must provide a **Channel ID** and an optional **Server ID**. Future updates may include a proxy list integration to automatically bypass rate limiting.
